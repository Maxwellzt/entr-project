                        <p class="text-muted">
                          There are many different types of debris in our orbit today. Objects ranging from prior launch waste, to broken down satellites,
                          meteorites, asteroids and much more. In the year 2013 there were already more than 500 000 pieces of debris being tracked by Nasa. 
                          Advancements in technology over the years began to increase this number at an exponential rate, with more satellites being launched
                          daily, and commercial space flights becoming highly available to the public.
                          </p>
                          <p class='text-muted'>Today, in 2049, Space Dusters is proud to say we have
                          developed a revolutionary way of mediating the problem of space debris. We use a wide combination of the world’s most revolutionary
                          technologies to tackle the problems faced within earth's orbit, but oddly enough, our company would not be  what it is today without

                  <h3>Material Analysis</h3>
                      <p class="text-muted">
                          We are able to scan every piece of debris before it enters the mouth of the ZZB-963x and determine exactly what it is comprised of,
                          within milliseconds of contact. With this information, we determine precise cut points on the item based on the materials within the debris.
                          Using our ships different laser systems, we
                          can cut up the debris into pieces as small as 1 cm in diameter to allow our sorting technologies to work with ease.
                          The cut points are determined by our highly sophisticated AI, which determines the best
                          cut points for separating valuables and recyclables from waste. After cutting, our polarization-controlled optical tractor beams take over in the sorting and 
                          collection phase of orbital clean up.

                  <h3>Material Sorting</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Utilizing a technology whos prototype only arose in late 2014, we can control the polarization of our lasers, effectively making a tractor beam through controlled zones of high temperatures.
                        By encapsulating materials within a cylindrical beam of heat produced by the laser, we can utilize the polarization of the beam to control the movement of materials with ease. 
                        We use this unique property in lasers to capture rare or recyclable materials, and hold them in place, while waste is directed to the appropriate disposable collection module.
                        When the waste has been contained, our unique rutter system activates exposing the collection module dedicated to valuable materials. Our tractor beams disengage and the
                        materials are effectively collected.

                        <p class="text-muted">
                          Space dusters relies on the collaboration with many industry leaders in technology and material sciences, and NASA has paired with our team at Space Dusters
                          to find a solution that effectively captures the debris after it has been cut down in the analysis phase, and seperated in the sorting phase.
                          The solution developed was large collection modules that are injected with NASA's Aerogel. Nasa’s Aerogel, has chemical and physical properties that allow for the
                          capturing a range of microscopic particles to much larger metals and rocks. Once the collection modules have reached a specific mass, 
                          the recyclable module detaches on a path to earth for processing and recycling, and the non-recyclable materials are directed into the sun, ensuring the waste is completely disposed of.
